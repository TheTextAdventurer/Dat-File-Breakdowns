# Scott Adams Dat File Breakdowns

This repository contains:
1. A collection of detailed, human readable versions of the first thirteen Scott Adams Adventure Game files.
2. Transformed and decoded versions of the Hint Sheets for Scott Adam's Grand Adventuresl, which can be found on the [donwloads page for Scott Adam's own website](https://www.msadams.com/downloads.htm).
3. Game maps generated from DAT files - these show the room connections, and some user inputs which can cause movement between rooms (e.g. GO HOLE).
