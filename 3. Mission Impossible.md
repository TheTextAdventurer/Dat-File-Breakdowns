| 13| The saboteur \(who also rewired the security system\) is a heart patient\. He plans to SUICIDE with the reactor\! He is still loosein the building\. You'll find Security keys & a map in the manila envelope lying next to the tape player\. |
| 14| politely beeps\.\.\.  |
| 15| angrily buzzes\.\.\.  |
| 16| Strange\.\.\. |

| 27| Click\! Room lights dim and a screen drops from the ceiling\. You hear a hidden projector start\. |
| 28| The screen illuminates for awhile, but no movie\!? |
| 29| The projector stops, the screen rises, and the lights return\. |
| 30| A movie runs telling about the reactor and its construction interesting highlights: 1\) Plastic DEFORMS strangely in radiation 2\) Even short exposure to HIGH radiation is LETHAL, so suit up  |
| 31| The radiation did something to my pail\! |
| 32| Holding a Radiation Suit |

| 47| the water soaks into the floor |
| 48| say again & use a color\! |
| 49| I'm looking into the control room\. I notice that the door is blocked by some debris\. |
